\section{Changes in version 0.1.7 (2025-03-22)}{
  \itemize{
    \item The CI setup was updated to use \code{run.sh} from
    \href{https://eddelbuettel.github.io/r-ci/}{r-ci} (Dirk).
    \item The windows build was updated to GSL 2.7, and UCRT support was
    added (Jeroen in \ghpr{16}).
    \item Manual pages now use JSS DOIs for references per CRAN request
    \item README.md links and badges have been updated
    \item Continuous integration actions have been updated several times
    \item The DESCRIPTION file now uses Authors@R as mandated
    \item Use of multiple cores is eased via a new helper function reflecting
    option \code{mc.core} or architecture defaults, used in tests
    \item An inline function has been added to avoid a compiler nag
    \item Support for exponential RNG draws \code{zrexp} has been added, the
    internal uniform generator is now also exposed via \code{zruni}
    \item The vignette bibliography has been updated, and switched to DOIs
    \item New package \pkg{zigg} is now mentioned in DESCRIPTION and vignette
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.1.6 (2020-10-18)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Several typos were corrected in the vignette (Blagoje Ivanovic
    in \ghpr{9}).
    \item New getters and setters for internal state were added to
    resume simulations (Dirk in \ghpr{11} fixing \ghit{10}).
    \item Minor updates to \code{cleanup} script and Travis CI setup (Dirk).
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.1.5 (2018-06-10)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Description rewritten using doi for references.
    \item Re-setting the Ziggurat generator seed now correctly re-sets
    state (Ralf Stubner in \ghpr{7} fixing \ghit{3})
    \item Dynamic registration reverts to manual mode so that
    user_norm_rand() is visible as well (\ghit{7}).
    \item The vignette was updated to accomodate pandoc 2* [CRAN request].
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.1.4 (2017-09-27)}{
  \itemize{
    \item The vignette now uses the pinp package in two-column mode.
    \item Dynamic symbol registration is now enabled.
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.1.3 (2015-07-25)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Use the \code{SHR3} generator for the default implementation
    just like Leong et al do, making our default implementation
    identical to theirs (but 32- and 64-bit compatible)
    \item Switched generators from \code{float} to \code{double}
    ensuring that results are identical on 32- and 64-bit platforms
    \item Simplified builds with respect to GSL use via the
    \CRANpkg{RcppGSL} package; added a seed setter for the GSL variant
    \item Corrected use of \code{fabs()} to \code{abs()} on integer
    variables, with a grateful nod to Brian Ripley for the hint (based
    on CRAN checks on the beloved Slowlaris machines)
    \item Accelerated Travis CI tests by relying exclusively on
    \code{r-cran-*} packages from the PPAs by Michael Rutter and myself
    \item Updated \code{DESCRIPTION} and \code{NAMESPACE} according to
    current best practices, and \code{R-devel CMD check --as-cran} checks
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.1.2 (2013-12-28)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Add a new generator deploying R's unif_rand which faciliates use
    of Ziggurat as the user-supplied generator for N(0,1)
    \item Update a 'local' demo comparing normal distribution RNGs from
    Boost, C++11 and Armadillo none of which are particularly speedy
    \item Add declaration to import a symbol from \CRANpkg{Rcpp} to
    \code{NAMESPACE} to ensure proper instantiation with the upcoming
    \CRANpkg{Rcpp} version
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.1.1 (2013-12-22)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Set dependency on R (>= 3.0.0) needed by vignette builder
    \item Remove pdf files in vignette on cleanup to ensure rebuilds
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.1.0 (2013-12-21)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Testing framework added with a standard RNG test, a new and
    similar test particular for Normal distributions, and the Chi^2 test
    from the Leong et al paper (JSS, 2005)
    \item New \code{demo()} functionality showing the three added tests.
    \item Code has been reorganized into separate headers implementing
    the generators, using a common (virtual) base class; and accessors
    and tests in the \code{src/} directory.
    \item Two new ziggurat generators implementations have been adapted
    from, respectively, GNU Gretl and QuantLib
    \item Added a \code{vignette}
  }
}

\section{Changes in version 0.0.1 (2013-10-06)}{
  \itemize{
    \item Initial basic package version, wrapping five different
    implementations
  }
}
