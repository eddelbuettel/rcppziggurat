Description: The Ziggurat generator for normally distributed random
 numbers, originally proposed by Marsaglia and Tsang (2000,
 <doi:10.18637/jss.v005.i08>) has been improved upon a few times
 starting with Leong et al (2005, <doi:10.18637/jss.v012.i07>).
 This package provides an aggregation in order to compare different
 implementations in order to provide a 'faster but good enough'
 alternative for use with R and C++ code. See the 'zigg' package
 for a lighter implementation for much easier use in other packages.
