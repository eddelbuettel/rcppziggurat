Description: The Ziggurat generator for normally distributed random numbers,
 originally proposed by Marsaglia and Tsang (JSS, 2000), has been improved 
 upon a few times starting with Leong et al (JSS, 2005). This package provides
 an aggregation in order to compare different implementations. The goal is to
 provide an 'faster but good enough' alternative for use with R and C++ code. 
 .
 The package is currently in alpha state. Unless you know what you are doing,
 stick with generators provided by R which have been extremely diligently tested.
